# DSP48A1

This project implements a behavioral Verilog model of the Xilinx Spartan-6 DSP48A1 slice, widely used in math-intensive FPGA applications. The design supports parameterized pipelining, pre-adder/subtractor, multiplier, and post-adder/subtractor functionality.

✨ Features

Supports both synchronous and asynchronous resets

Parameterized registers:

A0REG, A1REG, B0REG, B1REG

CREG, DREG, MREG, PREG

OPMODEREG, CARRYINREG, CARRYOUTREG

Flexible input routing:

B_INPUT = DIRECT or CASCADE

Configurable carry-in selection:

CARRYINSEL = OPMODE5 or CARRYIN

Modular design with gray_mux_sync and gray_mux_async for pipelining

Self-checking SystemVerilog testbench with directed test patterns

🧪 Verification

Simulated in QuestaSim / Vivado Simulator

Testbench includes 4 directed test paths verifying:

Reset operation

Pre-adder/subtractor

Multiplier

Post-adder with feedback and cascade paths

100 MHz clock constraint (Vivado XDC file)
